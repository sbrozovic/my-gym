# my-gym
MyGym app represents a system for keeping records of all members and staff of the gym.
Employees at the gym have an overview of all the members of the gym. They can add new members, change information on existing members or delete a member. The boss has the same set of options as the employees. Additionally, he can add, delete and change informations for employees. 
There is also a chart where members can communicate with employees.
